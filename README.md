# IIT-Madras-DA2401-Machine-Learning-Lab-End-Semester-Project

## 📌 Purpose of this Template

This repository is the **starter** for your End Semester Project submission in GitHub Classroom. You can implement your solution and push your work in this repository. Please free to edit this README.md file as per your requirements.

> **Scope (as per assignment brief):**
> Give an introduction to your repository here: Eg. This repository contains a complete implementation for ...
* This repository contains the code files(.py and .ipynb) or the algorithms and a report pdf.
---

**Important Note:** 
1. TAs will evaluate using the `.py` file only.
2. All your reports, plots, visualizations, etc pertaining to your solution should be uploaded to this GitHub repository

## 📁 Repository Structure

* Describe your repository structure here. Explain about overall code organization.
* The first file LR_KNN_XG.ipynb(algorithm1.py) file contains the implementations of the Logistic Reg, KNN, XGboost.I named only 3 algorithms
seperstely because I focused more on these 3 only .The file Some_other.ipynb(alogrithms2).py contains few other algorithms that I implemented.
There is also a pdf Report on the observations. The main.py file contains the main algorithm/ best algorithm I implemented which is KNN.

## 📦 Installation & Dependencies

* Mention all the related instructions for installation of related packages for running your code here.
* install basic libraries like numpy, scipy, sklearn, pandas etc.


## ▶️ Running the Code

All experiments should be runnable from the command line **and** reproducible in the notebook.

### A. Command-line (recommended for grading)

* Mention the instructions to run you .py files.
* I've done the algorithms in 2 .ipynb files (algorithms.py), all my
  implementations are in .ipynb files and .py files(these are the files when .ipynb files are converted to .py files). So please go through these
  .ipynb files to find the algorithms I implemented.

## You can further add your own sections/titles along with corresponding contents here:

## 🧾 Authors

**<K.Rishitha, DA24B040>**, IIT Madras (2025–26)


## Best Practices:
* Keep commits with meaningful messages.
* Please do not write all code on your local machine and push everything to GitHub on the last day. The commits in GitHub should reflect how the code has evolved during the course of the assignment.
* Collaborations and discussions with other students is strictly prohibited.
* Code should be modularized and well-commented.
